/* ============================================================
   Aviator — crash game engine, provably fair.

   Fairness model (the same commit–reveal scheme Spribe-style crash
   games use):

     1. Before betting opens, the round's `serverSeed` is generated and
        only its SHA-256 hash is shown to the player.
     2. The player may set their own `clientSeed`, mixed into the draw.
     3. The crash point is derived from SHA-256(serverSeed:clientSeed:nonce).
     4. After the bust, `serverSeed` is revealed. Anyone can re-hash it,
        check it matches the committed hash, and recompute the crash
        point — proving the round was fixed before any bet was placed.

   Rounds are still generated in the browser here, so this preview
   demonstrates the scheme rather than enforcing it. When Supabase lands,
   steps 1 and 4 move to the server: the hash comes down before the round
   and the seed is released after, which is what makes the guarantee real.
   A client that generates its own seed can obviously pick a nice one.
